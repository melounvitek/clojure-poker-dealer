# Clojure Poker dealer

Tiny app for teaching Clojure purposes.

It simulates a Texas Hold'em poker round (a simple one; without bets): it creates
a pack of cards, shuffles them, deals two cards to each player, and then it shows
board cards (flop, turn and river).

All code is in here: https://github.com/melounvitek/clojure-poker-dealer/blob/master/src/poker_dealer/core.clj
